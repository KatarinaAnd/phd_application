## MET2021
Contains code from the summer internship in 2021. `JSON_to_NetCDF.py` converts data from stationary stations in Frost (MET's API) from JSON to NetCDF. `XML_to_NetCDF.py` converts data from a buoy from AAnderaa, gathering information in Isfjorden from XML format to NetCDF. Both scripts have an additional configuration file (.cfg) that allows the user to specify the data period the user wishes to extract from the stations.
