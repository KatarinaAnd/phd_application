# Selected work for PhD Application

## [MET2021](https://github.com/KatarinaAnd/phd_application/tree/main/MET2021)
Contains python code from the summer internship in 2021. `JSON_to_NetCDF.py` converts data from stationary stations in Frost (MET's API) from JSON to NetCDF. `XML_to_NetCDF.py` converts data from a buoy from AAnderaa, gathering information in Isfjorden from XML format to NetCDF. Both scripts have an additional configuration file (`configuration_JSON.cfg` and `configuration_XML.cfg`) that allows the user to specify the desired data period to extract from the stations. `JSON_to_NetCDF.py` was co-authored by Øystein Godøy and Astrid Bergland, and `XML_to_NetCDF.py` was co-authored with Astrid Bergland.

## [Master thesis](https://github.com/KatarinaAnd/phd_application/tree/main/Master%20thesis)
Contains my submitted master thesis, "Using NORA3 to investigate the impact of inversion trends on NO2 concentration trends in Oslo and Bergen".

## [STK4900](https://github.com/KatarinaAnd/phd_application/tree/main/STK4900)
Contains assignment 2 from Statistical Methods and Applications (STK4900), showing numerically statistical analyzation of data using R. The code used for the assignment can be found at the end of the PDF-file.
